.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usba_hcdi_hub_update
entry point is an optional entry point for USB host controller drivers.
It is used by some controllers to allow them to update information about
a device in the controller after a device has been determined to be a
hub during enumeration. If a host controller does not need to take any
specific action after enumerating a hub, then it should simply set this
entry point in the
.Xr usba_hcdi_ops 9S
structure to
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Fa nports
and
.Fa tt
members provide relevant information from the device's hub class
descriptor which can be used to help program the host controller. Any
programming should be performed synchronously and be completed before
this function returns.
.Pp
This function will be called after
.Xr usba_hcdi_device_init 9E
has been called. Any private data registered with that function will be
available.
.Pp
If this function fails, the enumeration of this device will fail, the
hub driver will not attach to this USB device, and all devices plugged
into this hub will not be detected by the system.
.Sh CONTEXT
This functin is called from kernel context only.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn usba_hcdi_hub_update
function should return
.Sy USB_SUCCESS .
Otherwise, it should return the appropriate USB error. If uncertain, use
.Sy USB_FAILURE .
