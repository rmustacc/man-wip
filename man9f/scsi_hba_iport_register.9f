This interface is evolving still in illumos. API and ABI stability is
not guaranteed.

structure.

The name of the iport to add.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_register
function is used to create a new iport. For more information on iports
and their uses, see
.Xr iport 9 .
This interface is generally used then there are a fixed, static set of
iports that exist in the system. If the set of iports is dynamic or
related to phys coming online and offline, then the driver should
instead consider using the
.Xr iportmap 9
abstraction.
.Pp
The iport will be created as a child of the device represented by
.Fa dip .
The iport will be bound to the same driver. To distinguish nodes, the
driver should use the
.Xr scsi_hba_iport_unit_address 9F
function.
.Pp
The name of the iport, specified by
.Fa port ,
must be unique for a given parent. The iport will not be created if the
name is already in use. While names generally are based on unit
addresses, they may be synthetic names.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_register
function returns
.Dv DDI_SUCCESS .
Otherwise,
.Dv DDI_FAILURE
is returned.
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_register
function is generally called during the
.Xr attach 9E
entry point and may be called from
.Sy user
or
.Sy kernel
context.
