.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_create
and
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_destroy
functions are used by HBA drivers to create and destroy an iportmap. For
more information on an iportmap and its purpose, see
.Xr iportmap 9 .
.Pp
The
.Fa csync_usec
and
.Fa settle_usec
are both times measured in microseconds that control two different
properties of the iportmap and how it behaves. The value in
.Fa settle_usec
indicates the amount of time that the system should way to quiesce all
changes and consider the resulting system stable. Changes will not be
reported until after
.Fa settle_usec
have passed.
.Fa csync_usec
indicates how much time needs to elapse after creation before an initial
enumeration has been completed.
.Pp
The
.Vt dev_info
structure passed into
.Fa dip
is usually that for the HBA driver itself.
.Pp
When the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport
function returns,
.Fa iportmapout
will be populated with a pointer to an iportmap that can be used to add
and remove iports on.
.Pp
To destroy the iportmap, drivers should use the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_destroy
function. As part of destroying the iportmap, all associated iports will
be detached from the system by having the driver's
.Xr detach 9E
entry point called.
.Pp
When the driver needs to add an iport to the system, generally in
response to a hotplug event, then the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_add
function. The value of
.Fa ua
should be a character string that uniquely identifies the device. If the
driver is using a phymap, then this unit address should be the same one
as the phymap's callback passed. Otherwise, the driver should determine
a name to use, generally based on the iport's WWN, though the only
system requirement is that it be unique.
.Pp
When the corresponding iport needs to be removed, then the driver should
call the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_remove
function. The iport to remove is indicated by the
.Fa ua
argument, which should match the value passed into the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_add
function.
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_create
function is generally called during a driver's
.Xr attach 9E
entry point.
.Pp
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_destroy
function is generally called during a driver's
.Xr detach 9E
entry point.
.Pp
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_add
and
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_remove
functions should be called from
.Sy kernel
context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_create ,
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_add ,
and
.Fn scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_remove
functions return
.Dv DDI_SUCCESS.
Otherwise,
.Dv DDI_FAILURE
is returned.
