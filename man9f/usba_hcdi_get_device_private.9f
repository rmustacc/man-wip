Pointer to a USB device.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usba_hcdi_get_device_private
function obtains the private data set by a HCD driver. This private data
is created by the HCD driver's optional entry point
.Xr usba_hcdi_device_init 9E
and is removed during the HCD driver's optional entry point
.Xr usba_hcdi_device_fini 9E .
If an HCD driver does not implement these entry points then the value
obtained by a call will always be the null pointer,
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The framework provides no form of locking of this data and it is up to
the HCD driver to use whatever synchronization primitives it requires if
needed.
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn usba_hcdi_get_device_private
function is generally called from the context of a
.Xr usba_hcdi 9E
entry point, but may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The private data set by an HCD driver is always returned. If no such
value has been set, then
.Dv NULL
is returned.
