.Sy Volatile -
illumos USB HCD private function
.Pp
This is a private function that is not part of the stable DDI. It may be
removed or changed at any time.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width Fa
.It Fa dip
Pointer to the device's
.Sy dev_info
structure.
.It Fa hub_descr
Pointer to a byte array that contains the standard descriptors for a USB
Hub device.
.It Fa descr_len
The length in bytes of the
.Fa hub_descr
byte array.
.It Fa dev_descr
A filled in standard USB device descriptor.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_bind_root_hub
and
.Fn usba_hubdi_unbind_root_hub
functions are used to bind and unbind the root USB hub that is a part of
every host controller driver (HCD). See
.Xr usba_hcdi 9E
for more information on this relationship.
.Pp
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_root_bind_driver
is used after calling the
.Xr usba_hcdi_register 9F
function during a device's
.Xr attach 9E
entry point.
.Pp
Because the root hub provided by the HCD is a virtual Hub that
does not exist like a standard USB Hub, the HCD is responsible
for making it look like one.
.Pp
The contents of the
.Fa hub_descr
should be the standard USB Hub class-specific descriptor. This hub
descriptor should match a hub of a similar class of speed. For example,
with the xhci controller, a USB 3.x Hub class-specific descriptor is
used, whereas for the ehci controller, a USB 2.x Hub class-specific
descriptor is used. For more information, see the USB 3.1
specification, section 10.15.2
.Em Class-specific Descriptors .
.Pp
Similarly, the contents of the
.Fa dev_descr
need to be a filled in USB device descriptor that indicates that the
root hub corresponds to the appropriate USB generation. For more
information on the contents, see
.Xr usb_dev_descr 9S
and the USB 3.1 specification, section 10.15.1
.Em Standard Descriptors for Hub Class .
.Pp
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_unbind_root_hub
function is used to detach the root hub associated with the HCD.
This should be called during a device's
.Xr detach 9E
routine before calling
.Xr usba_hcdi_unregister .
.Pp
If a call to the
.Fn usba_hubdi_unbind_root_hub
function fails during a device's
.Xr detach 9E
function, then it should fail the call to
.Xr detach 9E .
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_bind_root_hub
function should only be called during a device's
.Xr attach 9E
entry point.
.Pp
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_unbind_root_hub
function should only be called during a device's
.Xr detach 9E entry point.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn usba_hubdi_bind_root_hub
and
.Fn usba_hubdi_unbind_root_hub
functions return
.Sy USB_SUCCESS .
Otherwise, they return
.Sy USB_FAILURE
to indicate that they could not proceed.
