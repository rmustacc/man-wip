.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_exists
function is used to determine whether or not
.Fa dip
has any child devices that are iports which have been added through
.Xr scsi_hba_iport_register 9F
or
.Xr scsi_hba_iportmap_iport_add 9F .
For more information on iports, see
.Xr iport 9 .
.Pp
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_find
function attempts to find a child iport and return its
.Vt dev_info
structure if it exists. The iport is searched for by its unit address,
which is passed in the
.Fa ua
argument. The unit address for an iport is established when the iport is
created.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_exists
function returns
.Sy 1
when there is a child iport of
.Fa dip .
Otherwise, it returns
.Sy 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_find
function returns a pointer to the iport's
.Vt dev_info
structure, if found. Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_exist
and
.Fn scsi_hba_iport_find
functions may be called in either
.Sy user
or
.Sy kernel
context.
