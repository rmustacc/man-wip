.Sy Volatile -
illumos USB HCD private function
.Pp
This is a private function that is not part of the stable DDI. It may be
removed or changed at any time.
.Sh PARAMATERS
.Bl -tag -width Fa
.It Fa dip
Pointer to the device's
.Sy dev_info
structure.
.El
.Pp
All other parameters are the same as the ones described and discussed in
.Xr open 9E ,
.Xr ioctl 9E ,
and
.Xr close 9E .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usba_hubdi_open ,
.Fn usba_hubdi_ioctl ,
and
.Fn usba_hubdi_close
functions are functions provided for the implementation of USB HCD
drivers. USB HCD drivers are required to implemnt the
.Xr open 9E ,
.Xr ioctl 9E ,
and
.Xr close 9E
.Xr cb_ops 9S
functions. In each of those functions, they should use the device number
to determine number in
.Fa devp
or
.Fa dev
to determine the device's corresponding
.Sy dev_info_t .
The USB HCD driver's entry points should then call the corresponding
function described above, passing all the arguments they received
unmodified.
.Pp
The USB HCD driver's entry points should return the value returned by
the call to the corresponding USBA function.
.Sh CONTEXT
These functions should only be called from the context of a USB HCD
driver's
.Xr open 9E ,
.Xr ioctl 9E ,
and
.Xr close 9E
entry points.
