.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_create
and
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_destroy
functions are used to create and destroy target maps. A target map is
used to manage SCSI and SMP (SCSI Management Protocol) devices. For more
background on target maps, see
.Xr tgtmap 9 .
.Pp
To create a target map, the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_create
function. Upon successful completion, a pointer to the target map will
be placed in the
.Fa tgtmapout
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa dip
argument should correspond to the HBA driver's device node or one of its
iports.
.Pp
The
.Fa mode
argument describes how addresses are reported into the target map and
the functions used to add and remove devices. If
.Fa mode
is
.Dv SCSI_TM_FULLSET
then the driver must always report all the devices that are in the set
and will be told when the corresponding devices have been removed. See
the section
.Sx Full-Set Reporting
for more information.
.Pp
Otherwise, the driver should set the
.Fa mode
argument to
.Dv SCSI_TM_PERADDR
and use the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add
and
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_destroy
functions. See the section
.Sx Per-Address Reporting
for more information.
.Pp
The
.Fa csync_usec
and
.Fa settle_usec
are both times measured in microseconds that control two different
properties of the target map and how it behaves. The value in
.Fa settle_usec
indicates the amount of time that the system should wait to quiesce all
changes and consider the resulting system stable. Changes will not be
reported until after
.Fa settle_usec
have passed.
.Fa csync_usec
indicates how much time needs to elapse after creation before an initial
enumeration has been completed.
.Pp
The
.Fa activate_cb
and
.Fa deactivate_cb
arguments are optional function pointers that will be run in the context
of devices being added and removed from the system. This allows the HBA
driver to perform any required operations prior to the system attaching
a target driver such as
.Xr sd 7D
or
.Xr ses 7D
in the activate case and after the system has detached the driver, in
the removal case.
.Pp
To destroy a target map, a caller should use the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_destroy
function. Destroying a target map causes all currently present will be
deactivated, as though they were removed.
devices to be deactivated, prior to the final destruction of the target
map.
.Ss Callbacks
Target maps allow for callbacks to be registered to be called when
devices are being added and removed from the system. A driver specifies
these when the target map is created by passing in function pointers to
the
.Fn activate_cb
and
.Fn deactivate_cb
arguments.
.Pp
When a new address is registered in a target map and the driver has
specified a function in the
.Fa activate_cb
argument, the driver will eventually have their activation function
called. This call will be asynchronous with respect to the adding and
removing of entries, regardless of whether the target map is using
per-address or full-set reporting. This call will occur before any
driver is bound to the discovered address.
.Pp
The
.Fa tgtmap_priv
argument will point to the optional, private argument that was passed
to the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_create
function when the target map was created. The
.Fa tgt_addr
and
.Fa tgt_type
will describe the address and type of the new device and will correspond
with the values passed into either the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_add
or
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add
functions.
.Pp
The
.Fa tgt_privp
argument is a modifiable private value. Initially,
.Fa tgt_privp
points to the value passed in as
.Fa tgt_priv
to either the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_add
or
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add
functions. The driver may change the value as needed. It will receive
the value stored in
.Fa tgt_privp
during the deactivate callback.
.Pp
When a target map has been updated to indicate that a device has been
removed then the driver will receive a deactivation callback if it
registered one. The deactivate callback will occur after a driver has
been detached from the corresponding device.
.Pp
The
.Fa tgtmap_priv ,
.Fa tgt_addr ,
and
.Fa type
arguments to the callback are the same as for the activate case. The
.Fa tgt_priv
pointer will be set to the value that was passed when the device was
added and will reflect any updates made during an activate callback, if
present.
.Pp
The
.Fa deact
argument gives the driver some amount of information as to why device
was being removed. The deactivation reason allows the driver to have a
more information about why the address was being removed from the target
map which can be useful in the cases that it itself did not issue it.
.Pp
The return value indicates whether or not some amount of rediscovery of
the address is desired or not. This is only meaningful in the case where
the
.Fa deact
argument was
.Dv SCSI_TGT_DEACT_RSN_CFG_FAIL .
If the driver does, then it should return
.Dv B_TRUE .
Otherwise, the driver should return
.Dv B_FALSE .
If in doubt, use the return value
.Dv B_FALSE .
Note, even if the driver returns
.Dv B_TRUE ,
no action may be taken by the system.
.Ss Full-Set Reporting
Full-Set reporting is one way of managing a target map. In full-set
reporting, whenever an update is being made, the entire data set is
reported to the target map. The target map then determines which
addresses are new, which have been removed, and which have stayed the
same and updates the system state appropriately. If devices have been
added or removed from the system, then any activate and deactivate
endpoints will be called.
.Pp
To begin a new report, the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_begin
function. Once the report has begun, the driver should add devices by
calling the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_add
function. Once all devices have been added, the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_end
function to indicate that the target map processing has ended. If driver
wishes to discard a report that has begun, but not yet terminated, then
the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_flush
function.
.Pp
When adding entries, the driver should indicate the address of the
device in
.Fa tgt_addr .
This will generally be a world wide number (WWN) in a unit-addressable
form. However, the driver may use its own synthetic numbering. This
address will be passed to the activate callbacks and will also be used
as the address of the
.Xr scsi_device 9S
in the
.Xr tran_start 9E
entry point.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument indicates how the kernel will interpret the type of device. At
this time, devices are broken into two broad categories. Things which
are some kind of SCSI device, whether parallel, SCSI, SATA behind a
SATL, SES, etc. should use the type
.Dv SCSI_TGT_SCSI_DEVICE .
The other group,
.Dv SCSI_TGT_SMP_DEVICE ,
is for SCSI Management Protocol (SMP) devices.
.Pp
The
.Fa tgt_priv
argument will be passed to the activate and deactivate callbacks,
allowing the driver to pass around data corresponding to this address.
.Ss Per-Address Reporting
When using a target map with per-address reporting, the driver is
responsible for indicating what devices have been added and removed.
This is useful for various hardware configurations where all entries and
removals are processes in a highly-reliable fashion where hardware
cannot drop entries.
.Pp
To add a new device, the driver should call the
.Fa scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add
function. The
.Fa tgt_addr
and
.Fa type
arguments describe the address and what kind of device the address
corresponds to. For more information, see the previous section,
.Sx Full-Address Reporting .
The
.Fa tgt_priv
argument will be passed along to the activate and deactivate functions,
allowing the driver to associate a value with the address in question.
.Pp
When a device has been removed, the driver should call the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_remove
function, ensuring that both the
.Fa tgt_addr
and
.Fa type
arguments match those that were used when calling the
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add
function.
.Sh CONTEXT
The
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_create
and
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_destroy
functions are generally called from the context of the
.Xr attach 9E
and
.Xr detach 9E
entry points of HBA drivers and their iports, though may be called
from
.Sy user
or
.Sy kernel
context.
.Pp
The optional
.Fn activate_cb
and
.Fn deactivate_cb
functions for a target map will be called into the driver from
.Sy kernel
context.
.Pp
The
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_begin ,
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_add ,
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_end ,
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_set_flush ,
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_add ,
and
.Fn scsi_hba_tgtmap_tgt_remove
functions may be called from
.Sy user
or
.Sy kernel
context. It is recommended that device drivers do not call these
functions from
.Sy interrupt
context and instead should schedule deferred work with a task queue
or with
.Xr timeout 9F
if they receive notifications during an interrupt that causes them to
need to call these functions.
