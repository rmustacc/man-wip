.Nd USBA Pipe Handle Data Structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/usb/usba/hcdi.h
.Sh INTERFACE LEVEL
.Sy Volatile -
illumos USB HCD private
.Pp
This is a private data structure that is not part of the stable DDI. It
may be removed or changed at any time.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy usba_pipe_handle_data
structure is the USB architecture's (USBA) way of representing a pipe.
Every pipe is a part of a USB device. Pipe's may be shared between
client drivers or be exclusive to one.  For more background on pipe's
see the
.Sy USB Endpoint Background
section of
.Xr usba_hcdi 9E .
.Pp
This structure is provided to HCD driver's when performing requests of
various kinds. The majority of the structures listed here are
.Em read-only ;
however, HCD drivers are allowed to update a single member, listed
below. All of the writeable members are protected by a lock, the member
.Sy p_mutex .
See the
.Sy Locking
section in
.Xr usba_hcdi 9E
for more information on lock ordering and when HCD drivers should enter
this lock.
.Pp
A pipe handle has an explicit life cycle wih a device driver. The driver
first sees the pipe handle when its
.Xr usba_hcdi_pipe_open 9E
entry point is called. At that time, the HCD driver has the change to
store private data on the handle. This pipe handle will be used in
subsequent requests until the handle is closed, through a call to the
HCD driver's
.Xr usba_hcdi_pipe_close 9E
entry point.
.Sh STRUCTURE MEMBERS
The
.Sy usba_pipe_handle_data_t
structure includes the following members:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
usba_device_t		*p_usba_device;
usb_ep_descr_t		p_ep;
usb_ep_xdescr_t		p_xep;
dev_info_t		p_dip;
usb_opaque_t		p_hcd_private;
kmutex_t		p_mutex;
int			p_req_count;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Sy p_usba_device
member points to the
.Xr usba_device 9S
structure that this pipe belongs to. This member should always be set
for an endpoint handed to an HCD driver.
.Pp
The
.Sy p_ep
member is filled in with the endpoint descriptor that represents this
device. The endpoint structure is documented in
.Xr usb_ep_descr 9S .
.Pp
The
.Sy p_xep
member is filled in with the endpoint descriptor and any additional
endpoint descriptors that may exist. The structure is documented in
.Xr usb_ep_xdescr 9S .
The endpoint descriptor is the same in both
.Sy p_ep
and
.Sy p_xep .
.Pp
The
.Sy p_hcd_private
member is reserved for use with HCD drivers. An HCD driver may set
this member during
.Xr usba_hcdi_pipe_open 9E .
If set, it can reference this member throughout the life time of the
pipe. The driver should ensure to clean it up when its
.Xr usba_hcdi_pipe_close 9E
entry point is called.
.Pp
The
.Sy p_mutex
member protects the member
.Sy p_req_count .
The mutex should be entered whenever the value is being manipulated.
.Pp
The
.Sy p_req_count
member indicates the number of outstanding requests on the pipe. When
performing
.Em periodic
interrupt or isochronous transfers, it is the responsibility of the HCD
driver to increment the value of
.Sy p_req_count
if it duplicates a request with either
.Xr usba_hcdi_dup_intr_req 9F
or
.Xr usba_hcdi_dup_isoc_req 9F .
.Pp
Similarly, if the device driver for some reasons removes a request it
duplicated without submitting it to the USBA, it should decrement the
member.
.Pp
The HCD driver should take special care to ensure that the value of
.Sy p_req_count
is always greater than one. There should always be an outstanding
request that an HCD driver has for the pipe, especially if it is a
periodic endpoint. It should only manipulate this member while it owns
.Sy p_mutex .
